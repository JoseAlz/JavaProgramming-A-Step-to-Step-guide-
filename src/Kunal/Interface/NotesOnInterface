1)  All methods in an interface must be an abstract method.
2)  Variables declared in the Java Interface are by default final.
3)  An Interface cannot have a constructor, remember its variables are final which means it cannot be overridden.
4)  An abstract class can provide the implementation of the interface
    but the interface cannot provide the implementation of the Abstract class
5)  In the abstract class, we use 'Extends' keyword, but in the interface class, we use 'Implements' keyword.
6)  An Interface can implement multiple interface but an abstract class can only extend one.
7) Interface to Interface, we use the keyword extends, Classes to Interface, we use the keyword implements.
8) Static interface methods should must have a body.
9) Interfaces are used in Java to achieve abstraction. By using the implements keyword, a java class can implement
   an interface. In general terms, an interface can be defined as a container that stores the signatures of the methods
   to be implemented in the code segment. It improves the levels of Abstraction.
