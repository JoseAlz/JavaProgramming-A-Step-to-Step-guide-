/**         NOTES ON CLASSES, OBJECTS, VARIABLES AND METHODS
 * An Object is anything that exists, it can be Human, Biro, Air.
 *  What an Object have is called Instance Variables, and What an object can do is called Methods.
 *  A Class is a blue-print, Template or Contract that defines what an Object data fields and Methods will be.
 *  You can create many instance of a class, and the process of creating an instance of a class is called INSTANTIATION.
 *  An Object is more often called an INSTANCE
 *  A Class uses Variables to define data fields, and uses Methods to define Actions.
 *  A Class provides methods of a special type, known as CONSTRUCTORS, which are invoked to
 *  create a new object. A constructor can perform any action, but constructors are designed to
 *  perform initializing actions, such as setting the default values of Variables. */
